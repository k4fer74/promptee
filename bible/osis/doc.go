package osis

// OSIS is an XML standard for encoding Bibles and other biblical research texts,
// which enables ministries and other organizations to collaborate more easily.
//
//Traditionally, these organizations have stored their documents in disparate,
// proprietary markups, making it difficult when they wish to share in service with each other.
//
//OSIS provides a common markup for multiple visions.
